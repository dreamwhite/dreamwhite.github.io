# Introduction

Maccy is a lightweight clipboard manager for macOS. It's free and open source and doesn't even use much RAM in the average usage.

# Download

It can be downloaded both from its [official GitHub page](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy) or via `brew` by using `brew install maccy`.

# Usage

The basic usage is pretty simple: press `SHIFT (⇧) + COMMAND (⌘) + C` to popup Maccy or click on its icon in the menu bar.

It will popup and show you the last `200` history items copied (can be changed from the app settings) and will never let you lose track of your copied items.

You can read more on its usage on the official GitHub page.
