As every year during 2022 WWDC Apple announced their new operating system called **macOS 13 code-name Ventura**.
I'm not there to list every major change on this new version of macOS but what actually we want is the compatibility for our hackintoshes.

More in depth many hardware configurations that were supported in macOS Monterey, are now unsupported.

#### SMBIOS

**Extracted from macOS Ventura /System/Library/CoreServices/PlatformSupport.plist**

- `iMac16,1`
- `iMac16,2`
- `iMac17,1`
- `MacBook9,1`
- `MacBookAir7,1`
- `MacBookAir7,2`
- `MacBookPro11,4`
- `MacBookPro11,5`
- `MacBookPro12,1`
- `MacBookPro13,1`
- `MacBookPro13,2`
- `MacBookPro13,3`
- `Macmini7,1`
- `MacPro6,1`

This basically means that no more support is available for pre-Coffee Lake hardwares unless patching the system using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher) when it'll get updated.

#### GPU Support
