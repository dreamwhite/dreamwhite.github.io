As every year during 2022 WWDC Apple announced their new operating system called **macOS 13 code-name Ventura**.
I'm not there to list every major change on this new version of macOS but what actually we want is the compatibility for our hackintoshes.

More in depth many hardware configurations that were supported in macOS Monterey, are now unsupported.

#### SMBIOS

**/System/Library/CoreServices/PlatformSupport.plist differences between macOS Ventura and macOS Monterey**

- `iMac16,1`
- `iMac16,2`
- `iMac17,1`
- `MacBook9,1`
- `MacBookAir7,1`
- `MacBookAir7,2`
- `MacBookPro11,4`
- `MacBookPro11,5`
- `MacBookPro12,1`
- `MacBookPro13,1`
- `MacBookPro13,2`
- `MacBookPro13,3`
- `Macmini7,1`
- `MacPro6,1`

This basically means that no more support is available for pre-Kaby Lake hardwares unless patching the system using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher) when it'll get updated.

#### GPU Support

That's probably the most importante one, as many people may not have a recent AMD GPU (thx chip shortage). More in depth, the following kexts got dropped:

- `AMD7000Controller.kext`
- `AMD8000Controller.kext`
- `AMD9000Controller.kext`

**Please note that NVidia Kepler GPUs are not listed since they weren't supported on macOS Monterey without [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher)**
This means that only the following GPUs will be still supported on macOS Ventura:
