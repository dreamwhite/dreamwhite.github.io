My name is Ivan Cafiero, or more commonly known as dreamwhite. I'm a software developer and in my spare time I do hackintoshes, including co-founding [Utopia Team](https://github.com/utopia-team). This blog will contain some researches I'll make

### Why hackintoshes? How you discovered them?

I'm not that good at writing but I'll try to sum up things

When I was 7, my father gave me a CD with Ubuntu 8.04. Here is the moment when I started learning Linux and getting more confident with it.
In 2010 I discovered VirtualBox and VMWare and started testing OSs on my father's Dell XPS M1330. Here I discovered MacOS X (the good ol' times w iATKOS and Chameleon). This was my first experience with Apple OS then I abandoned it for a few years when...

In 2019 I knew this geeky guy who had macOS Mojave 10.14.3 on his laptop. I started asking him how he did stuff and he suggested me [Hackintosh Italia Telegram group](https://t.me/hackintoshitalia) where I firstly got in touch with Clover bootloader. After becaming way more active in that community I became rapidly a mod.


### Where did the name dreamwhite come from?


Idk honestly, I have a bad memory atm, but from what I remember vaguely, I was in a smol lamer group (I'm a little bit embarassed in this but hey, every geek started off there, don't lie to me haha) where there was a guy who was called `dreamblack`. My stupid mind decided to merge the `white hacker` thing with that name and there we go.
